Hello, %recipient_fname%!

We are just one week away from the event, so it's time to switch from theme submission to theme selection! https://goo.gl/forms/WOaXNmaF4zJwWbHP2

If you haven't signed up (or know someone that should) make sure you do as soon as possible. We need to get an accurate headcount for food.

For those of you that haven't attended the event before, this is a two-day event, but it's not an overnight event. The office is available to you from 9am-5pm on Saturday and 9am-6pm (or later to accommodate demos) on Sunday.

We hope to see you next weekend!

- Scott
