<p>Hello, %recipient_fname%!</p>

<p>We are just one week away from the event, so it's time to switch from theme submission to theme selection! <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/WOaXNmaF4zJwWbHP2">https://goo.gl/forms/WOaXNmaF4zJwWbHP2</a></p>

<p>If you haven't signed up (or know someone that should) make sure you do as soon as possible. We need to get an accurate headcount for food.</p>

<p>For those of you that haven't attended the event before, this is a two-day event, but it's not an overnight event. The office is available to you from 9am-5pm on Saturday and 9am-6pm (or later to accommodate demos) on Sunday.</p>

<p>We hope to see you next weekend!</p>

<p>- Scott</p>
