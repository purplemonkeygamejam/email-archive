Hello, %recipient_fname%!

We are less than one month away from the Purple Monkey Game Jam. It's time to ask you what you think the theme should be! Please note that in the instructions we're asking for general themes only. Non-specific themes allow for a wider range of creativity and more fun!

Theme Survey Link: https://goo.gl/forms/egWjQZa6oi3ZJEZw2

Remember, tickets are limited due to the size of the event space, so be sure to pick up your ticket as soon as possible. And be sure to tell your friends!

Looking forward to seeing you in a few weeks!

- Scott
