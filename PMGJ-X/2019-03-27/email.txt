Hello, %recipient_fname%!

It's that time of year again; GDC has wrapped up, PAX East is upon us, and the Purple Monkey Game Jam is right around the corner. This year the game jam will take place on May 18th and 19th, hosted by Cantina in downtown Boston. The hours are the same as last year with doors opening at 9 am and closing at 6 pm both Saturday and Sunday.

Keeping with the structure of last year's event, we will be not be having a keynote or talks before we begin on Saturday, giving you the most amount of time to form teams and start working on your games.

We will be sending out a survey for theme suggestions soon, followed by another survey for voting on your favorite themes.

If you have any questions regarding the event, please don't hesitate to reach out. You can respond directly to this email, message us on Twitter or via the Meetup event page.

We hope to see you soon!

- Scott
