Hello, %recipient_fname%!

If you can believe it, April is already here! And with it, the 8th Purple Monkey Game Jam! There are limited tickets available due to the size of the event space, so register while you can!

Theme submissions are now open and can be submitted through https://goo.gl/forms/DkDENYy4IgpDZMAq1. As stated on the form, please keep the submissions simple and non-specific.

We are also looking for a keynote speaker. So if you or anyone you know would like to give a talk before the game jam kicks off please reach out to us via email (hello@purplemonkeygamejam.com) or Twitter.

Looking forward to seeing you in a few weeks!

- Scott
