<p>First of all thank you, everyone, who attended the event this weekend! All of the games presented were amazing! You should all be really proud of what you were able to accomplish in just two days.</p>

<p>As mentioned before presenting our games, there is an itch.io game jam page created for this event. Submissions are open until May 1st. If you are unable to upload your game before then, please respond to this email and I can manually add it. <a href="https://itch.io/jam/purple-monkey-game-jam-april-2017">https://itch.io/jam/purple-monkey-game-jam-april-2017</a></p>

<p>We have also put together a quick survey that, if you have a few minutes to fill out, would help us better plan the next event. <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/PVPJzC4YbemHGkdj2">https://goo.gl/forms/PVPJzC4YbemHGkdj2</a></p>

<p>Thank you again! See you at the next game jam!</p>
