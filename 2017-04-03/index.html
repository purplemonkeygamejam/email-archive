<p>If you can believe it, April is already here! And with it, the 8th Purple Monkey Game Jam! There are limited tickets available due to the size of the event space, so <a href="https://www.meetup.com/purplemonkeygamejam/events/237966197/">register</a> while you can!</p>

<p>Theme submissions are now open and can be submitted through <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/DkDENYy4IgpDZMAq1">https://goo.gl/forms/DkDENYy4IgpDZMAq1</a>. As stated on the form, please keep the submissions simple and non-specific.</p>

<p>We are also looking for a keynote speaker.
