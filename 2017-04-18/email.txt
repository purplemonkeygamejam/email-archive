Hello, %recipient_fname%!

This is it â€“ less than a week until the game jam kicks off!

If you are planning on going and have not signed up yet please do so as soon as possible. We need to get an accurate headcount so we can figure out how much food to order.

Just a reminder, even though this is a two-day event, it is not an overnight event. We will be wrapping up at 6 pm on both Saturday and Sunday (although we might extend that time to accommodate demos). Parking close to the event can be found at 280 Congress Street (the Atlantic Wharf Garage) for $12. http://www.atlanticwharfoffice.com/amenities/garage/

See you this weekend!
